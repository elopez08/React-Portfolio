This is the next part of the Portfolio making.  Please look at the "Beginning and Navbar" first BEFORE coming here!

1.  Import both {motion} and {images} from 'framer-motion' (animation) and '../../constants' respectively

2.  Understand what the files are doing.  As you are editing, comment out with {/**/} on the "Navbar" on the "App.js" to get a clear view on what you're editing.

3.  Go over all the properties for the "Header.jsx" since there's a lot to take in.  There are a lot of properties that have been established as well as the "motions" that has been issued when we wrote the codes down.

4.  Don't forget to deply the "scaleVariants" not only on the bottom, but also on the top as a const.

Something to note is that there's a property called "whileInView".  As the name suggests, something happens only while it is visible.  When we reloaded the page, we could see the text flying from across the screen and circles appearing.  Remember that it has "transition" properties to go by.  Mapping something out is from the property "/constants" for the "images".  Remember that some are also "rendering", so the value of what's being displayed depends on the name.  This changes constantly.

One of the things that happened when it didn't displayed right was the name not being typed right.  CHECK YOUR WRITING!

One other thing that was also incorrect was having two ">" and that broke the code.

5.  When you are done, go to "Header.scss" to finish the styling.  We're going to need additional code for the "Header" and we need to go to the ".scss" file for it.

6.  When you get to the section that involves ".app__header" and you do the "padding" property, add back the "Nav" to see the results.

7.  Add in three media queries that allow the shape of the forms to be resized depending on the size of the screen.

8.  Remember to pay attention to the properties of the .scss.  Also, make sure that the names are PROPERLY written!  One of the things we used constantly that looks a bit hard to distinguish is the _ _(together).  If the name is incorrect, it will not render properly
