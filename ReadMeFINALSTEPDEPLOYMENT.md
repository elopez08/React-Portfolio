The finale.  We need to deploy this to make sure it is available for the public.  Needless to say, this MUST be taken as the absolute last step.  Everything else has been modified, added, designed, implemented, and read.  We have the server working, we have Sanity being read.  We even have data being inserted in the system.  


1.  Stop EVERYTHING!  YOU MUST also be in "frontend_react".

2.  Issue:
```
npm run build
```

This will then build up the application.  We'll be using this:

netlify.com
